# myRetail RESTful Service
Tessa Ganser

To run the project:
-------
To run the program, first download the folder.

In your terminal/command line, navigate into the main program folder.
To bring in dependencies, type:
`npm install`

I used node.js on  this project. To start the server, type:
`node server.js`

This brings up the server. If it is working it will print ```"listening on port 6000"``` to the command line.

A new mongoDB will be created- for more information and to download mongoDB see: https://www.mongodb.com/

For more information- see comments directly in the code.

Testing the project:
-----------------------

I used Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) to test my code.
